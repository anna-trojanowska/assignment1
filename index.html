        <p>I know some of you other seniors out there must have some amazing rescue stories. I would love to hear about them and share a few on this page. If one story inspires one human to adopt one senior dog, that's a success to me. Plus, I love a good cry.<span>– Susie</span></p></blockquote>
        
        <h2>Toots</h2>
        
        <p>TULSA, OK: Hey, Toots! If there's one lady that wants to be  cat called forever, it's Toots.</p>
    
        <p>The Animal Rescue Foundation of Tulsa wrote, <q>Toots' estimated date of birth is June 16th 2002. Toots first came to ARF when she was 5 years old. She was adopted out and much to ARF's dismay she ended up at the Tulsa shelter 5 years later picked up as a stray. Her tattoo was spotted and she is now back with ARF. Toots is a sweet little girl. She is a little shy right now as she can't understand how her life got so turned upside down. She is looking for a quiet home to spend her retirement years being loved and cherished to never end up at a shelter again. She knows her adoption chances are very slim because of her age but she's hoping there is a special home out there for her.</q></p>
    
        <p>We can increase the odds of finding a forever home for Toots...you know what to do!</p>

        <h2>Soo</h2>
        
        <p>NEW YORK CITY: Need a best friend? Well, look no further than Soo! She is an 11 year old Maltese, and she is the perfect best buddy.</p>

        <p><q>I was picked up as a stray by a good samaritan. Animal Haven found that I have a microchip but the information is out of date. This means that I am available for adoption! My experience of being a dog on the street has left me frightened at the idea of being alone. I love being around people! That's when I feel the most comfortable. Please consider me to be your companion!</q></p>

        <p>This sweet girl has experienced the hard life and now she really needs a human she can trust.</p>

        <h2>Trina</h2>
        
        <p>SEATTLE, WA: Yesterday we had the privilege of visiting with sweet Trina. She is a 12 year old American staffordshire terrier and boxer mix that was surrendered to the Seattle Humane Society when her humans could no longer afford a dog.

        <p>Trina is a personal favorite of staff member Jenna (who showed us around the shelter) and as soon as we met her, we understood why. She's a very playful, yet calm, senior with excellent manners. She instantly become one of our favorites, too!</p>

        <p><q>Our vet staff performed a dental surgery for Trina and treated an infected wound on her back paw when she first came to us. She has a skin tag on her chest (benign, no action needed). She can live with other dogs but not cats. She can be reactive on a leash around other dogs, but is much better off the leash. She knows “sit” and “down" and can go to a home with children of all ages.</q> Overall, Trina is a very healthy senior with lots of love to give!</p>

        <h2>Peanut</h2>
        
        <p>SALT LAKE CITY, UT: If you're reading this and haven't noticed Peanut's underbite yet, please stop reading and look now. Ok, now look again.</p> 

        <p><q>Miss Peanut is a 10 pound chihuahua mix with an infectious smile. Her underbite will melt even the coldest heart. You cannot help but fall in love the second you lay eyes on her. She is 14 years young and still happy as can be. She will shower you with affection and climb in your lap. Her owner died so she and the heeler she lived with were surrendered at the shelter. She gets along with cats, dogs and kids as well and she is house trained.</q></p> 

        <p>Peanut has more years on her than she does body weight, but some things just get better with age. And her adorable face is one of them!</p>
